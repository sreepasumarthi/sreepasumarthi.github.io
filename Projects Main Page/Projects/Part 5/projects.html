To do so, we will construct process maps – which include an entrance, buffers, workstations, and decision points – and run multiple simulation models 200 times using the SimQuick software. Based on these results, we will focus on identifying and modifying the bottleneck. Along with this, we will observe how the bottleneck is impacted if the interarrival time decreases from 12 to 10 minutes. Lastly, we will provide recommendations to improve the process, along with the costs and trade-offs associated with them.

Of the three segments, E&P is the most profitable, accounting for most of the net income. The largest segment is R&M and the smallest is petrochemicals. Midland’s main goal is to develop a financial strategy that is based on four pillars: overseas growth, value-creating projects, capital structure optimization, and the repurchase of undervalued shares.

The latter’s customizable nature was utilized for estate and retirement planning,, and while it constituted less than 10 percent of total volume, this policy accounted for almost half the total revenues, making it a critical component of success.

        <img class="size" src="images/oc.png" data-text="Ocean Carriers is an international shipping company that operates capesize dry bulk carriers to transport materials such as coal and iron ore worldwide. The business operation model relies mainly on time – chartering vessels on a “time charter” or “spot charter” basis. The charterer pays a daily hire rate for the duration of the contract and determines the materials transported. In turn, Ocean Carriers provides a seaworthy vessel, compliant with international regulations. Currently, Ocean Carriers is considering a lease proposal for a ship over three years, beginning in 2003. However, Ocean Carriers does not possess ships in its fleet that meet the customer’s expectations. This report serves to guide Mary Linn, Vice President of Finance for Ocean Carriers, to decide whether or not to commission a new carrier, and the amount of time this asset will be held.

Visitors from around the country and world flock to Utah to absorb all the state has to offer with its beautiful backdrops and scenic attractions. However, as these parks become more well-known for their beauty, problems regarding visitor experience arise, including long wait times, congested parking areas, and poor bathroom maintenance to name a few. Besides the customer side of the visitor experience being poor, the environmental condition of these parks is taking a hit as well.  With longer waiting times to view the attractions, social trails are created, which can damage soil and kill vegetation. To tackle these problems, we will look at managing capacity as the main target.">
