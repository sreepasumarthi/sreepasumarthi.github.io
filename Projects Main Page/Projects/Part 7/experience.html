                <li>Performed data cleaning and explored historical incident data by using Python libraries (Pandas &
                    NumPy). Used this data to develop a routing algorithm to assign incidents to appropriate teams,
                    increasing team productivity by 30%.
                </li>
                <li>Performed NLP classification task and text preprocessing in Python to prefetch resolution details
                    from past incidents. This provided context sensitive content to analysts, and decreased incident
                    resolution time by 400%. </li>
                <li>Developed an algorithm in Python to predict issue resolution time by performing feature-engineering
                    with historical incident data, allowing the team to provide impacted users with an accurate
                    resolution time.
