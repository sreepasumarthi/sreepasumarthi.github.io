        "modaldetails": "In this case, we will analyze a local hospital’s ER process by observing the midnight shift (12:00 AM - 8:00 AM), during which one customer arrives every 12 minutes, following an exponential distribution. To do so, we will construct process maps – which include an entrance, buffers, workstations, and decision points – and run multiple simulation models 200 times using the SimQuick software. Based on these results, we will focus on identifying and modifying the bottleneck. Along with this, we will observe how the bottleneck is impacted if the interarrival time decreases from 12 to 10 minutes. Lastly, we will provide recommendations to improve the process, along with the costs and trade-offs associated with them.",

        "modaldetails": "Ocean Carriers is an international shipping company that operates capesize dry bulk carriers to transport materials such as coal and iron ore worldwide. The business operation model relies mainly on time – chartering vessels on a “time charter” or “spot charter” basis. The charterer pays a daily hire rate for the duration of the contract and determines the materials transported. In turn, Ocean Carriers provides a seaworthy vessel, compliant with international regulations. Currently, Ocean Carriers is considering a lease proposal for a ship over three years, beginning in 2003. However, Ocean Carriers does not possess ships in its fleet that meet the customer’s expectations. This report serves to guide Mary Linn, Vice President of Finance for Ocean Carriers, to decide whether or not to commission a new carrier, and the amount of time this asset will be held.",
